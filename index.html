          <p>
            Space Quad is an innovative solution for damage detection on the International Space Station with
            its advanced sensor technology and autonomous systems. VAMUdeS Space designed a safe, efficient
            and reliable platform which would allow to detect and prevent potential catastrophes to happen
            to our astronauts due to space debris.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Platform</h2>
          <p>The Space Quad platform has been designed with reusability and safety as top priorities.
            It has also been designed to make the most of the current technologies and tools used on the ISS.
            This Unmanned Space Vehicle (USV) can dock with the Canadarm using its conventional docking port
            and then uses its RCS system to navigate to otherwise unreachable areas, leveraging its power reserves
            and generation based on solar cells and lithium-ion batteries to extend the station self-diagnostic
            tools. The platform has been designed to reach similar speeds as the Canadarm (0,6m/s) and has an
            array of lidar systems to detect and avoid collisions. The on-board control system also makes use of
            its optically calibrated inertial complex, comparing its dynamic features to known position of the
            ISS to generate a safe trajectory. Finally, the USV can be docked with the station using the Canadarm,
            allowing it to replenish its fuel cells and power.</p>
          <p>Main technical features
            <ul>
              <li>
                Canadarm docking capabilities
              </li>
              <li>
                Main structure made of Carbon Fiber that could be coated to protect from radiation
              </li>
              <li>
                2 modules of 4 RCS Thrusters for complete range of motion
              </li>
              <li>
                2 360 degrees lidar sensor to detect and avoid collisions
              </li>
              <li>
                8 solar panels
              </li>
              <li>
                RCS gas storage with refueling capability
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Control System</h2>
          <p>
            The Space Quad platform is controlled autonomously using a combination of proximity sensors and modelized
            trajectory planning. There are two proximity lidar systems installed on the USV, allowing it to have a
            complete view over its surroundings. The platform has internal linear and angular acceleration sensors,
            allowing it to position itself relative to the space station’s referential system. To account for the drift
            that may be created in the positioning system, a laser calibration module using retroreflector positioned
            on the space station has been designed. The trajectory of the Space Quad platform is generated using all
            the positioning data to ensure a complete coverage of the station’s surface with our analysis tools.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Propellants</h2>
          <p>
            A liquid form of hydrozine ( N2H4 ) and dinitrogen tetroxide are used as propellants for the
            unmanned space vehicle . The fuel ( hydrozine ) and the oxidant ( dinitrogen tetroxide ) are
            stored in fuel tanks inside the USV . Two fuel lines are connected to the combustion chamber
            through the injectors . Since the dinitrogen tetroxide is used as a catalyst , the atomization
            and the mixing of the products will trigger the decomposition of the hydrozine . This highly
            energetic reaction is then directed to one or many nosels of the RCS .
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Blind spot accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            Able to identify damage currently not accessible from windows or Canadarm. With sensor able to capture
            images in different directions, it is possible to capture damages that are not currently seeable from the
            windows
            of the ISS or from cameras already installed on the ISS.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Compatible with Canadarm</h2>
          <p>
            Can navigate around ISS with Canadarm. A docking station on the drone is made to be compatible with
            the Canadarm so the drone can navigate around the ISS without using too much fuel. The drone has some
            handles to attach to the Canadarm.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Autonomous Missions</h2>
          <p>
            The Space Quad handle custom mission planning for more efficient missions when needed.
            This means the mission times will vary depending on the type of mission that is made.
            If a full automatic mission is made, data acquiring can take up to an hour, but if a
            specific region of the ISS is targeted, a mission could take as low as fifteen minutes.
            Life feedback status of the drone is shown on the mission software, this ensures everything
            is going as scheduled during the mission. It is possible to have a manual takeover is necessary.
            Three autonomous controllers are installed for redundancy and high reliability.
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/auto_mission.png" alt="">

          <h2 class="section-heading">Mission Planning</h2>
          <p>
            With mission planning software, it is very easy to plan the mission on the ISS, send the mission to
            the drone and follow the live status of the mission on the space station.
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/mission_planning.png" alt="">


          <h2 class="section-heading">Data Transmission</h2>
          <p>
            Live data transmission to ISS with frequency based transmission. This technology is proven and works well
            in different environments. Data processing on ISS to reduce the payload size and enables to have more
            powerful computers do the processing than on board. It is also possible to take control more easily of the
            data processing. It is also easier to make software updates and to add custom functions to the image
            analysis software.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Safe Distance Flight</h2>
          <p>
            The drone will fly at 15-20 m from ISS. This is close enough for detailed images while being a safe
            distance for manual takeover. A distance a little further reduces missions time but reduces the quality of
            the data received. With high resolution sensors, a 15-20 m distance is totally acceptable and make possible
            to get data from damage as small as 0.5 mm in diameter.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Design by Nature</h2>

          <p>
            Indicatoridae are indicator birds used by humans to guide them to bee hives . The birds search for the
            emplacements of the hives and later transmit the information to man through a special singing tone .
            Inspired by them , the unmanned space vehicle searches for the emplacements of the space debris and damages
            on the International Space Station and transmits the information to the ISS’s astronauts . The astronauts
            will then share the data with Mission Control on Earth .
